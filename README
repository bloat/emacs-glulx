This is an implementation of the Glulx virtual machine in Emacs
Lisp. Since all input and output from Glulx is via the GLK library
there is also an Emacs Lisp implementation of the GLK specification.

Both Glulx and GLK are inventions of Andrew Plotkin. For more
information on Glulx and GLK see:

Also contained here is a fork of the GLK Frotz implementation of
Infocom's Z-Machine virtual machine maintained by Tor Andersson. This
version of GLK Frotz has been modified only to make it work with the
Emacs GLK implementation given here. Its README and License are
reproduced here:

Everything here (everything written by me that is) is incomplete,
ill-considered, and half-baked.
