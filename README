This is an implementation of the Glulx virtual machine in Emacs
Lisp. Since all input and output from Glulx is via the GLK library
there is also an Emacs Lisp implementation of the GLK specification.

Both Glulx and GLK are inventions of Andrew Plotkin. For more
information on Glulx and GLK see:

Everything here (everything written by me that is) is incomplete,
ill-considered, and half-baked.
